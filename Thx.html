    <h2>My name is Raziel "Zen" Rojas and I am a senior at Cape Cod Tech. When I first thought of creating a website, I wanted to focus on colas or sodas that I have tried, but that idea was denied, so I made this. It was interesting to see what a college campus looks like in person, even though the tours were rather boring. I plan on going to college for at least a bachelor's degree which I am still widdling down on what I will go for. I was set on cybersecurity for a while, but since I started working with my father in the funeral service, I have thought more about working in the medical field. Either way, I plan to work hard so I can achieve great wealth in the future.</h2>
